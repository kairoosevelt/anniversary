    <h1>Happy 9th Month Anniversary 🤍</h1>

      <p>
        Nine months ago, we began something quietly special.
        No shared spaces, no physical distance to cross —
        just two people choosing each other, one message at a time.
      </p>

      <p>
        What we have may exist across screens and time zones,
        but it has always felt real.
        Real in the way you listen.
        Real in the way you stay.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some days, our world fits inside a screen.
        Some nights, your voice is all I need.
        And somehow, you never feel far —
        you feel like home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for staying.
        For being patient.
        For turning something virtual
        into something deeply meaningful.
      </p>

      <p class="highlight">
        Here’s to us,
        and to everything we’re still becoming 🤍
      </p>

      <p class="fun">
        and yes… if our love can survive bad signals,
        late replies, and “can you hear me now?” moments,
        I think we’re doing pretty great 😄
