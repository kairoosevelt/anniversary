        Dear <strong>Vira April Listiana</strong>,<br>
        my beloved <strong>bebe</strong> 🤍
      </p>

      <p>
        Nine months ago, we started something that didn’t follow the usual rules.
        No shared city, no holding hands, no walking side by side —
        just two people choosing to stay, choosing to talk, choosing to care.
        And somehow, that choice was enough to make everything feel real.
      </p>

      <p>
        What we have began virtually,
        but nothing about my feelings for you has ever felt distant or artificial.
        From the very beginning, you felt familiar —
        like someone my heart already recognized before my mind could explain why.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through screens, messages, and late-night conversations,
        you became a part of my daily rhythm.
        The person I look forward to hearing from.
        The one who makes ordinary moments feel lighter, warmer, and more meaningful.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love how our time together doesn’t need grand gestures.
        Sometimes it’s just us playing, laughing at small things,
        or simply existing in the same moment — even if miles apart.
        Those moments may look simple from the outside,
        but to me, they mean everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        You have this quiet way of making me feel understood.
        Of making me feel seen.
        Even when words are few, your presence is always enough.
        You turned waiting into patience,
        distance into trust,
        and time into something worth holding onto.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for staying, bebe.
        For choosing me again and again, even when it’s not always easy.
        For being soft when I need comfort,
        and playful when I need joy.
        For being my favorite notification,
        my favorite voice,
        and my favorite person.
      </p>

      <p>
        What I love isn’t just the moments we share,
        but the person you are in every one of them.
        The smile behind the screen.
        The energy you bring into my world.
        The way you make “virtual” feel deeply personal and real.
      </p>

      <p class="highlight">
        Nine months with you has taught me that love doesn’t depend on distance —
        it depends on intention.
        And with you, that intention has always been clear 🤍
      </p>

      <p class="funny">
        and yes… I also love how you somehow tolerate my randomness,
        my sudden jokes, and my competitive side when we play 😌
        clearly, you deserve a lifetime supply of love for that.

        these are simple things,

        moments we play together,
        and the person who makes those moments special.
